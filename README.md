# Balanced Muscle Perk
A properly balanced fork of Dr_Newbie's [Muscle Perk Deck](https://modworkshop.net/mod/27990) mod for *PAYDAY: The Heist*.

This mod makes PD:TH significantly easier by increasing your maximum health, giving passive health regeneration, and adding a small chance for nearby enemies to immediately surrender upon firing your weapon. 

This fork is intended to correct balancing issues with the original mod. Notably, the probability that an enemy would be intimidated upon hearing your firearm was originally 0.35 - a 35% chance. This was extremely broken with automatic weapons, leading to situations where entire rooms of enemies would immediately surrender after only a few shots had been fired.

The goal of this fork is to allow for a passive health regeneration mechanic, as well as easier accumulation of new hostages via the random surrender mechanic, *without* completely trivializing gameplay as the original mod did.

This mod requires [DorHUD](https://modworkshop.net/mod/14267).
