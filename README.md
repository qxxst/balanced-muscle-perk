# Balanced Muscle Perk
A properly balanced fork of Dr_Newbie's [Muscle Perk Deck](https://modworkshop.net/mod/27990) mod for *PAYDAY: The Heist*.

This mod makes PD:TH significantly easier by increasing your maximum health, giving passive health regeneration, and adding a small chance for nearby enemies to immediately surrender upon firing your weapon.

This mod has been superseded by the [Hybrid Perk Deck](https://github.com/qxxst/hybrid-perk-deck). I won't be actively updating it anymore, but I'll leave it available to download if people prefer this version. Feel free to create a pull request if necessary.
## Disclaimer
**THIS MOD IS A CHEAT.** It makes the game easier. Don't use it in public servers.

## Effects
When using this mod:
- You will have 80% extra base health.
- You will passively regenerate 0.6% of your health every second.
- Each shot from your firearms has a 0.1% chance of intimidating nearby enemies, forcing them to surrender.
  - You can then yell at them to cuff themselves like normal.

You can change these numbers to be whatever you want by editing the five variables in `upgradestweakdata.lua`. For context, I have also added comments next to each variable that briefly explain what it does and what its previous value was in the original mod. 

This mod does not include any effects from the other Perk Deck mods. Again, if you're interested in that, check out the [Hybrid Perk Deck](https://github.com/questmatrix/hybrid-perk-deck), which adds perks from Muscle *and* Rogue.
